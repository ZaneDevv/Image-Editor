# üñåÔ∏è Image-Editor

This is a simple and open source project to edit imges in web full made by me from scratch. The idea was to make a simple image editor such as pohotoshop that allows you to edit using only a web browser any image at a simple level.
The target also was make it without any kind of framework, using only the simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes.

Feautures:
<ul>
    <li>Create a project by specifing the size of the canvas</li>
    <li>Create a project by importing a background image</li>
    <li>Import text</li>
    <li>Import images</li>
    <li>Rotate</li>
    <li>Zoom in/out</li>
    <li>Warning messages when you are editing an image and you tried to either close or refresh the window</li>
</ul>

### Creating project

When you need to create a new project, you have two clar options: either you create a new canvas from scratch by specifing its width and height or you import a image you have downloaded on your device.
